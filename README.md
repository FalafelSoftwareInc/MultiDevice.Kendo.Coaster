MultiDevice.Kendo.Coaster
=========================

The Multi-Device Kendo UI Coaster presents a great starting point for building Multi-Device Hybrid apps in Visual Studio and Kendo UI Core (Kendo UI Mobile). It provides a modular structure for the code and allow you to easily grow your application. 

What does it include?
=====================

- A sample view displaying a Kendo UI ListView
- A proper structure for your mobile app
- Kendo UI Mobile Framework and Core references
- Logging wrapper for JNS Log (http://jsnlog.com/) supporting both console and remote appenders
- Easily display alerts in your app using a properly configured Toastr
- Pub/Sub pattern for components communication using the famous Amplify Pub Sub
- Dataaccess library to both local and remote data (http://jaydata.org/)

Known Issues
============
- I am using the Kendo UI Core CDN because the local version is not working properly. I will get that fix asap.
